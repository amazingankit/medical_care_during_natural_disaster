# medical_care_during_natural_disaster

Overview-
Flood bring a lot of diseases with it .People affected by it requires medical help .But there are not enough doctors to meet this requirement.Through this project I want to build a system so that some doctors voluntarily do check up of these patients through video conferencing without actually visiting the flood affected areas.

Problem to be solved-
Due to flood many people are forced to leave their house and live in some rescue shelter. Because of lack of clean drinking water,sanitation, unfavorable weather and so on many people get sick.They require immediate medical help.But number of doctors in these rescue shelter are very less. Although many doctors wants to help them but they don't want to go to flood affected regions. Through this project I will try to solve this problem and provide medical help to these people.

Solution--
Technology can be used to solve this problem.Doctors can do initial check up through video call. In this way they can help affected people from there home without actually visiting flood affected region. Rescue shelter should be equipped with equipment to carry basic medical test. For more complex test, drone can be used to transport blood samples from rescue shelter to laboratory. Similarly medicines can be transported using drone.

Steps to be taken by government --
Government should identify rescue shelter before actual flood hit. People should be mobilised to these shelter during flood. These shelter should be equipped with basic medical equipments, medicines and TV. Government should ensure power supply even during flood to these shelters.Solar panels with big batteries can be proved useful to supply power during natural disaster. An uninterrupted internet connection should be provided to these shelters.

My contribution --
I will create a website to motivate doctors across the nation to voluntarily help by giving their valuable time . Doctors will be able to book a slot whenever they are free through this website.After booking slot they can interact with patients through Skype or any other mean. This website will also show number of patients in each rescue shelter so that effective division of manpower can be done.Medicines requirements can be also known and required medicines can be delivered to rescue shelter.
